# Python Labs 4-11

This repository contains my implementations for Labs 4-11 from the Python course. Each lab focuses on different programming concepts and tasks.

## Lab 04 - Pi Approximation

Approximate the transcendental number Pi using partial sums of two infinite series and numerical solutions of the equation sin(x) = 0. Implement functions for Gregory-Leibniz series, Nilakantha series, and Newton's method for finding roots.

## Lab 05 - Polynomials

Create functions for basic polynomial operations: evaluating a polynomial at a given point, summing two polynomials, and multiplying two polynomials. Polynomials are represented as lists of coefficients, with the first element being the constant term.

## Lab 06 - Data Sorting

Implement a stable sorting algorithm. Create functions to sort a list of numbers in ascending or descending order and to sort data based on associated weights. Ensure proper input validation and handle exceptions for invalid input data.

## Lab 07 - Showroom

Develop a simple car database using a doubly linked list. Implement functions to initialize the database, add cars, update car details, activate/deactivate cars, and calculate the total value of active cars. Ensure the list remains sorted by car price.

## Lab 08 - Binary Search Tree

Implement a binary search tree (BST) with methods to insert nodes, build the tree from an array, search for values, find minimum and maximum values, and track the number of visited nodes. Ensure the tree maintains unique values and proper structure.

## Lab 09 - Permutations

Generate all permutations of a given list of elements using recursion. Implement a function that returns a list of all possible permutations of the input list. Avoid using external libraries and focus on understanding the recursive approach.

## Lab 10 - Dijkstra's Algorithm

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a graph. Create classes for vertices and edges, and a Dijkstra class to manage the graph and compute paths. Ensure the algorithm handles cycles and uses a priority queue for efficiency.

## Lab 11 - Homer's Fridge

Create a system to manage a virtual fridge for Homer Simpson. Implement functions to find the maximum expiration day, generate a histogram of expiration days, sort food by expiration, reverse the fridge contents, and remove specific food items. Ensure the fridge remains organized and functional.
